# Desktop App

Codex-style Electron shell for `pi`, with Playwright E2E coverage organized by test lane.

macOS remains the source of truth for desktop UI verification. Linux is supported for packaging and manual validation, with CI packaging checks to catch AppImage regressions.

## Setup

Install workspace dependencies once:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

Build the desktop app:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop build
```

Run the app in development:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop dev
```

`dev` now runs through `electron-vite`, so renderer edits hot-update in place and Electron `main` / `preload` changes trigger the appropriate reload or restart behavior automatically. The desktop dev launcher also rebuilds the shared workspace packages up front and keeps them in watch mode so Node-side package changes can be picked up without manual rebuilds.

Run the built app locally without packaging:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop preview
```

Package a Linux AppImage locally:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run package:linux
```

Live agent tests use your existing `pi` runtime and provider auth. If local `pi` runs do not work, the `live` lane will not be meaningful either.

## Test Lanes

Use the smallest lane that matches the changed surface.

- `core`
  Background-friendly Electron UI coverage. This is the default lane for renderer, sidebar, composer, persistence, settings, skills, and worktree UI behavior.

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:e2e
  pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:e2e:core
  ```

- `live`
  Real runtime/provider coverage. Use this when the change depends on an actual run, transcript item, tool call, or background notification.

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:e2e:live
  ```

- `native`
  macOS OS-surface coverage such as folder pickers, image pickers, and real clipboard paste. This lane is foreground-only and can take focus.

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:e2e:native
  ```

- `production`
  Opt-in higher-fidelity smokes that stay out of the default fast lanes. Use these for real-auth `live` checks, packaged `.app` launch, and real macOS open-panel coverage.

  ```bash
  pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:prod:real-auth-contract
  pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:prod:packaged-smoke
  pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:prod:applications-relaunch
  pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:prod:release-zip-smoke
  pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:prod:open-folder-real
  ```

Run all desktop lanes:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:e2e:all
```

For mac-first CI, use:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:e2e:ci:mac
```

Linux CI currently validates packaging via:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run package:linux
pnpm --dir apps/desktop run verify:packaged-runtime-deps:linux
```

## Focus And Foreground Rules

- `core` and most `live` scripts set `PI_APP_TEST_MODE=background` for you. Agents normally should not set that env var manually.
- `native` scripts set `PI_APP_TEST_MODE=foreground` for you and may steal focus.
- If a native test fails, rerun it with a clean foreground window before assuming the product is broken.
- Picker tests rely on macOS Accessibility/UI scripting. If folder or image picker automation cannot type into the dialog, check system Accessibility permissions first.
- `production` open-panel coverage also relies on macOS Accessibility/UI scripting and should be run with the app kept frontmost.

## Targeted Commands

Use a targeted script while iterating.
Rerun the matching lane before closing for `core` and `live`.
For `native`, rerun the targeted native spec by default and expand to `test:e2e:native` only when the change touches shared native helpers, multiple native specs, or lane-wide native behavior.

```bash
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:core:worktrees
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:core:persistence
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:live:tool-calls
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:native:paste
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:native:open-folder
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:native:attach-image
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:prod:real-auth-contract
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:prod:packaged-smoke
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:prod:applications-relaunch
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:prod:release-zip-smoke
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:prod:open-folder-real
```

For real-auth `live` specs, opt in explicitly:

```bash
PI_APP_REAL_AUTH=1 PI_APP_REAL_AUTH_SOURCE_DIR=/absolute/path/to/agent \
  pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:e2e:runner -- apps/desktop/tests/live/submit-run.spec.ts

PI_APP_REAL_AUTH=1 PI_APP_REAL_AUTH_SOURCE_DIR=/absolute/path/to/agent \
  pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:e2e:runner -- apps/desktop/tests/live/tool-calls.spec.ts
```

For dev-loop verification, use:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:dev:reload
```

That spec launches the app in development mode, edits isolated probe modules for renderer/Electron/shared-package wiring, and proves the running window picks up the changes.

## Test Conventions

- Shared helpers live in [`tests/helpers/electron-app.ts`](./tests/helpers/electron-app.ts). Extend them instead of adding another Electron harness.
- Prefer real clicks, typing, keyboard shortcuts, and visible assertions.
- Avoid direct IPC shortcuts for visible behavior unless the user surface does not exist yet. If you must use one, document why the surface gap exists.
- `pasteTinyPng()` drives the renderer paste handler directly and is appropriate for background-safe coverage.
- `pasteTinyPngViaClipboard()` uses Electron clipboard plus `webContents.paste()` and is appropriate for foreground/native coverage.
- `tests/production/real-auth-contract.spec.ts` proves the default non-real-auth path still seeds a temporary fake-auth agent dir and keeps real-auth coverage opt-in.
- `tests/production/packaged-smoke.spec.ts` proves the packaged `.app` bundle launches and can start a thread through the real UI.
- `tests/production/applications-relaunch.spec.ts` proves an installed copy under `/Applications` launches and relaunches with persisted state.
- `tests/production/release-zip-smoke.spec.ts` proves the packaged release ZIP can be extracted to a temp download-style path and launched through the real UI before publish.
- `tests/production/open-folder-real.spec.ts` proves the real macOS open panel can add a workspace through the empty-state button.

## Lane Map

- `tests/core`: deterministic in-window behavior
- `tests/live`: real agent/runtime behavior
- `tests/native`: macOS OS-surface behavior
- `tests/production`: opt-in higher-fidelity smokes kept out of the default lane globs

Future agents should start by reading this file, `apps/desktop/tests/AGENTS.md`, and the scripts in `apps/desktop/package.json`.
